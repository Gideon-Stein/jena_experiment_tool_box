# Soil moisture preprocessing

This folder contains notebooks for processing soil moisture data from the dedicated sensor network and validating the resulting products.

## Contents

- moisture_preprocessing.ipynb: transforms raw moisture data into cleaned and combined outputs; also generates advanced data products.
- moisture_preprocessing_checks.ipynb: quality checks and validation plots for moisture products.

## Notes

Moisture preprocessing uses dataset-specific quality filters and aggregation rules. Review notebook parameters before running on new data.
